# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks to model and solve complex tasks.
These neural networks are inspired by the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected nodes. Each layer processes information and extracts features, allowing the system to learn and make decisions on its own.
In deep learning, the term "deep" refers to the use of multiple layers in the neural network. These layers enable the model to automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, capturing intricate patterns and relationships.

# Machine Learning

machine learning is a branch of AI where computers learn from data to make predictions. It includes supervised learning (labeled data) and unsupervised learning (unlabeled data).

# Computer Vision

computer vision enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. It involves developing algorithms for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition. This technology is vital in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical image analysis, enhancing various industries with visual understanding.
